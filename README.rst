Version control with Subversion and Git

This is a basic introduction to version control with Subversion and Git.

Building the presentation from source
=====================================

If you want to build this presentation from source you will need:

- Python Docutils_

  Docutils_ provides the ``rst2html`` and ``rst2s5`` commands used to
  generate the HTML version of the presentation.


- Inkscape_

  Inkscape is an open-source vector illustration program that was used to
  create the illustrations in this presentation.  While in theory any
  application that will convert from SVG to PNG will work, the Makefile
  assumes Inkscape (and other applications may generate images with
  slightly different bounding boxes or other aspects that could affect the
  appearance of the presentation).
