Why version control?
====================

- Protection.

  Version control is like having infinite undo.

   Imagine that you are working on some code.  You get it working, but
   then make a few additional changes.  You return to the code later that
   day to find that you broke it.  Version control makes it easy to see
   what has changed.

   You release some code, and a month later someone finds a critical bug.
   In the intervening month your code has diverged substantially, making it
   difficult to fix what may be a simple problem.  Version control makes it
   easy to return to a previous state of your code in order to fix a
   problem without losing all of your intervening work.

Why version control?
====================

- Isolation.

  Version control makes it easy to experiment with your code.

Why version control?
====================

- Collaboration.

  Version control makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same
  project.
